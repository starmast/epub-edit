# Text Extraction Test Results

## Test Overview
Testing XHTML text extraction and reconstruction for LLM processing.

## Test Files
- `test_text_extraction.py` - Basic functionality test
- `test_text_extraction_detailed.py` - Detailed multi-chapter test
- Test ePub: `epub_test.epub` (12 chapters)

## Test Results

### ✓ ALL TESTS PASSED

1. **HTML Tag Removal**: ✓ PASS
   - All HTML tags (`<p>`, `<div>`, `<h1>`, `<b>`, etc.) are removed from plain text
   - LLM receives only clean plain text content

2. **Content Preservation**: ✓ PASS
   - Word counts are preserved (or slightly reduced due to combining lines)
   - No text content is lost during extraction

3. **Structure Reconstruction**: ✓ PASS  
   - Plain text is properly reconstructed into valid XHTML
   - `<?xml>` declaration, DOCTYPE, and `<html>` structure preserved
   - Content wrapped in appropriate `<p>` and `<h1>` tags

4. **Blank Line Handling**: ✓ PASS
   - Excessive blank lines reduced to single blank lines between paragraphs
   - Preserves paragraph structure for readability

## Sample Output

### Original XHTML (with tags)
```xml
<h1>Chapter 1</h1>
<p>There was only emptiness at the end of the long path of cultivation.</p>
<p>It had already been 300 years since Lu Qing came here.</p>
```

### Extracted Plain Text (sent to LLM)
```
Chapter 1

There was only emptiness at the end of the long path of cultivation.

It had already been 300 years since Lu Qing came here.
```

### Reconstructed XHTML (after editing)
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<body>
<h1>Chapter 1</h1>
<p>There was only emptiness at the end of the long path of cultivation.</p>
<p>It had already been 300 years since Lu Qing came here.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

## Conclusion

✓ Text extraction is working correctly
✓ LLM will receive clean plain text without HTML markup
✓ Edited text is properly reconstructed into valid XHTML for ePub export
✓ Content and structure are fully preserved
